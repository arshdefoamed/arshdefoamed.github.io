	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Advantages and disadvantages of different VR and AR platforms</h1>
	<p>Virtual reality is defined as an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment, that incorporates mainly auditory and visual, but also other types of sensory feedback like haptic [1]. Whereas, augmented reality is defined as the experience where real life objects are “augmented” by computer generated information across visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory senses [2]. The demos in the Electronic Visualization Laboratory consisted of HTC vive, Microsoft hololens, CAVE 2TM and augmented reality applications on android and apple phones. Following are their advantages and disadvantages based on my experience:</p>

	<b>HTC vive</b><br>
	HTC vive is a virtual reality device and the demos included Google Earth and a virtual reality game. Both of the demos were highly intuitive and immersive. Following are the advantages and disadvantages of this platform<br>
	<i>Advantages</i><br>
	<ul>
	<li>The device had good response speed which results in real life like simulations</li>
	<li>The device gives the user the ability to walk around thereby transcending the traditional game environment where user has to stand at one place and simply use game controls</li>
	<li>The interactive environment opens the infinite possibilities in the field of entertainment, education and training</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<i>Disadvantages</i><br>
	<ul>
	<li>he device has a wired power source, thereby restricting the movement of a person to the length of wire</li>
	<li>The device is very bulky and will not be applicable for long term usage</li>
	<li>Since the device covers the whole eyes and the user is not able to observe the change in environment, there is a possibility of accidents while user is using the device</li>
	</ul>
	<b>Holo lens</b><br>
		<p>Holo lens is a mixed reality device, combining virtual reality and augmented reality in one device. The demo included an informative demo of the human anatomy. Following are its advantages and disadvantages:</p>
	<i>Advantages</i><br>
	<ul>
	<li>The device generates 3d holograms over existing objects thereby giving a unique interactive experience of the simulation	</li>
	<li> Since, the device is wireless, this gives user the ability to roam around and interact with simulation without any restrictions</li>
	<li>The user can see their environment around and hence there is a lesser probability of accidents while interacting with the simulation.</li>
	</ul>
	<i>Disadvantages</i><br>
	<ul>
		<li> The degree of view is small</li>
		<li> Since there are no controllers with holo lens, the freedom to interact with the simulation is less</li>
		<li> As a user it was difficult to wear this device, as it resulted in pain on the nose.</li>
	</ul>

	<b>CAVE 2</b><br>
		<p>Cave 2 is the large scale virtual reality system developed by UIC. It consists of large array of screens that are used to display 3d images and provide a 360 degree from a person's perspective.</p>
	<i>Advantages</i><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Since there is no wearable device needed except for a 3d glass. There is no physical strain on a user.</li>
		<li>A person's point of view is used as part of simulation. This makes it a great tool for walkthroughs</li>
		<li>The models can be zoomed in and zoomed out thereby making it ideal for informative demos where a particular item of interest can be zoomed in or out for better clarity</li>
		<li>There is a very low probability of accident as the user's line of sight is not at all affected.</li>
	</ul>
	<i>Disadvantages</i><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Requires lots of space to function</li>
		<li>Needs a large amount of hardware</li>
		<li>Fast animations might result in motion sickness</li>
		<li>High energy requirements</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Cell phone applications- virtual reality</b><br>
		<p>Virtual reality applications required a card board lens to provide depth perception. The demos included the apps titled withinvr and Google cardboard. Following are the advantages and disadvantages of using these apps:</p>
	<i>Advantages</i><br>
	<ul>
		<li>The head gear is not bulky</li>
		<li>The components are cost effective</li>
		<li>Since the platforms are either Android or iPhone OS, it's easy to develop new simulations as there is a good community support for creating apps</li>
	</ul>
	<i>Disadvantages</i><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Controlling is tough as there are no consoles for controlling</li>
		<li>There is a danger of accident as the view sight of the user is blocked</li>
		<li>Since this is not a dedicated console, the performance depends on the device configuration. hence the results will vary across the devices</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Cell phone applications- augmented reality</b><br>
		<p>Augmented reality cell phone applications required a predefined artifact to be scanned. When device was successfully able to detect the artifact, the simulation started. Following are the advantages and disadvantages of the platform:</p>
	<i>Advantages</i><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Cost effective as only a printed piece of paper as artifact is needed</li>
		<li>No external console/device is required</li>
		<li>Easy control as everything is shown on the device screen.</li>
	</ul>
	<i>Disadvantages</i><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Sometimes device is not able to detect the artifact</li>
		<li>The simulation models take up a lot of space on the device</li>
	</ul>

	<b>Conclusion</b><br>
		<p>Overall, my experience was great with respect to use of different platforms. There are few drawbacks/ bottlenecks for each device but they are not deal breakers in terms of a marketability. With time and the continuous research these devices will become much better and cheaper and we will see a much better consumer acceptance of these products.</p><br>
