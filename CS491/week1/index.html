	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Advantages and disadvantages of different VR and AR platforms</h1>
	<p>Virtual reality is defined as an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment, that incorporates mainly auditory and visual, but also other types of sensory feedback like haptic [1]. Whereas, augmented reality is defined as the experience where real life objects are “augmented” by computer generated information across visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory senses [2]. The demos in the Electronic Visualization Laboratory consisted of HTC vive, Microsoft hololens, CAVE 2TM and augmented reality applications on android and apple phones. Following are their advantages and disadvantages based on my experience:</p>

	<b>HTC vive</b>
	HTC vive is a virtual reality device and the demos included Google Earth and a virtual reality game. Both of the demos were highly intuitive and immersive. Following are the advantages and disadvantages of this platform
	<i>Advantages</i>
	1. The device had good response speed which results in real life like simulations
	2.	The device gives the user the ability to walk around thereby transcending the traditional game environment where user has to stand at one place and simply use game controls
	3.	The interactive environment opens the infinite possibilities in the field of entertainment, education and training
	<i>Disadvantages</i>
	1.	The device has a wired power source, thereby restricting the movement of a person to the length of wire
	2.	The device is very bulky and will not be applicable for long term usage
	3.	Since the device covers the whole eyes and the user is not able to observe the change in environment, there is a possibility of accidents while user is using the device
