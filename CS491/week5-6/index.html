		<h2 style="text-align: center;">Reviewing other projects AKA looking the world through other's lens</h2>
		<p>
			Me and my friend Vani spent 1 month working on augmented reality application to make breakfast more fun. After 1 month of hard work we were able to put together an application which worked quite well. As part of evaluation component Dr. Andrew asked us to review the applications made by others. Now, I am not really good at judging people as its tough for me to put myself into someone else's shoes. So, I wont be able to understand the kind of efforts the other people put into their project. So, as a review I will express how I felt whle using the application and try to give some constructive criticism.

		<h3>Zaynab Almoujahed, Dana Dolat - Harry Potter Themed Magical Breakfast</h3>
		<h4>Summary and description</h4>
		<p>	
			Zaynab and Dona chose the theme of Harry Potter for their augmented reality application. Each cereal box represented one house with their colors, one character,one teacher and one creature as the representative. Each teacher is animated and each character has a sound. These scenes are wonderful to watch and as a childood harry potter fan, there was a feeling of joy to watch those characters come to life again. Following are the couple of snapshots for the same:

		<p>The placemats depicted the dining hall and the Quidditch field. The animations and sound effects were spot on. I liked the sound of sorting hat  shouting Gryffindor and the animations of Quidditch field were lovely. One could relive the spirit and intesity of the competition that was offered by the game of Quidditch. Following is its screenshot: </p>

		<p>The magazines depicted daily prophet and wizarding world advertisments. There were few interesting innovations in the newspaper. First one included the 3d model of Voldermot. The second one included the video of Dumbledore escaping in style. Third page included the animation of a flying car which was the depiction of real event in a 3d model. All of these three depictions are one of the few ways in which our news media industry can evolve. It would be an interesting research study for the design students to find which of these ways would be the best medium for news </p>

		<p>The drink cans included Hagrid's hut with Buckbeak and cup of tea. The second drink can converts into butterbeer with hagrid at one side and his scary three headed dog, his tarantula and a dragon at the top. These scenes looked quite bland but were correct depictions from the movie. You cant otally imagine that hagrid would happily hangout with a dragon, tarantula and three headed dog. It will be quite a headache for him to control all those three magnificent beasts but he loves them all the same. Since the image was quite big I was unable to put everything in one snapshot. But you can see Hagrid,half of the dragon, the dog and legs of the tarantula.</p>

		<h4>Constructive criticism</h4>
		<p>
			To cut to the chase here is my critique. Following are its good points:
			<ul>
				<li>Each and every scene was the correct depiction of the theme.</li>
				<li>The animations were quite smooth</li>
				<li>The sound effects were pleasant, not loud and were according to theme</li>
				<li>There were alot many innovative ideas that were explored in the project</li>
			</ul>
			However, there were many things that could have been done better or were not explored:
			<ul>
				<li>The size of the scenes were not according to the scale. It took me some effort to take snapshots of the scenes</li>
				<li>The interactions were not explored at all</li>
				<li>The dynamics for the drink cans could have been executed much better</li>
				<li>There were no handmade models which was one of the requirements of the project</li>
			</ul>
			Overall, I like the  application. Agreed, there were few things from the assignment which were not at all touched. But whatsover things were attempted they were attempted fully and alost perfectly. I cannot wait to see the application to be developed fully. However, this is totally dependent on the developers and if they are willing to spend time on it. I can say for sure that they have good creativty and eye to detail. And that is one of the most important skill in any field
